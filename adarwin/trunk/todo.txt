Fail fast (first rule passes stops further introspection of the whole path)

When a rule that requires another rule(s) as a parameter is constructed, if the
parameter does not match a rule let the Exception point out that the rule requires a
rule as a parameter, not a String.

Add code to test that true rules always work, regardless of the amount of code

Write tests for ant task (missing parameters, conflicting parameters)

Write interface for RuleBuilder

Write tests for rules file (white-space, parathesis, extra-parameters, variables)

test use variable

write tests for depending on Exceptions

Ensure that when rule matching classes are printed they are printed in alphanumeric order.

Consider migrating the complexity of rule parsing out of
rule builder and into the individual rule classes

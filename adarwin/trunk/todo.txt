Fail fast (first rule passes stops further introspection of the whole path)

When a rule that requires another rule(s) as a parameter is constructed, if the
parameter does not match a rule let the Exception point out that the rule requires a
rule as a parameter, not a String.

Make the counter more accurate!

Add code to test that true rules always work, regardless of the amount of code

Rename Grammar to Bindings

Write tests for rules file (white-space, parathesis, extra-parameters, variables)

Write tests for ant task (missing parameters, conflicting parameters)

Write interface for RuleBuilder

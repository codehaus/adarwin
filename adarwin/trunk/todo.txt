Fail fast (first rule passes stops further introspection of the whole path)

When a rule that requires another rule(s) as a parameter is constructed, if the
parameter does not match a rule let the Exception point out that the rule requires a
rule as a parameter, not a String.

Add code to test that true rules always work, regardless of the amount of code

Write tests for ant task (missing parameters, conflicting parameters)

Write interface for RuleBuilder

Write tests for rules file (white-space, parathesis, extra-parameters, variables)

test use variable

write tests for depending on Exceptions
